</p>
<p>
We need to act as if we are a user(customer) so we have to go to this web address http://localhost/osTicket/. This will send you to the osTicket support page where you can create a ticket. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
now it will bring you to a page to file out information about, contact info, help topic, ticket details, and issue details. For this scenario I said the companies CFO's laptop is leaking information now we have to deal with the ticket accordingly. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
now sign in using the account of an agent that you created(see previous osTickt tutorials) 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
once you log into the the agent account, will be taken to the osTicket dashboard. Locate the tickets tab on the the right side of the screen and you will see all the open tickets under your name(Agent) 
</p>
<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
Open the ticket and you will be directed to a page that shows you all the information about the ticket created.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now change the SLA plan to fit according to your scenario, along with changing the priority level for the scenario. Based on my scenario(CFO laptop is leaking info) so I changed the priority level to emergency and the SLA to Sev-A
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Finally I go to transfer departments over to system adminstratiors in this scenario because the deal with company internal affaris. I then update my response to the ticket to "coordinate with sys admin team to work on fix for CFO Laptop" then click post reply at the bottom of the page. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now you will be sent back to the ticket dadshboard. There you can see the updated Ticket. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
In my ticket scenario a fix has been found by someone in incident response. So the CFO's laptop should now stop leaking information. on The Agents end you need to update the response then update the ticket status and the bottom of the page, then click post reply. This is an example of going through a tickets lifecycle.
